# classical_pendulum
Small project for solving the classical pendulum using different numerical approaches.

Directories:
* ODE: The ODE directory contains the direct solution of the simple pendulum ODE using SciPy. A jupyter notebook and a python file are included.
* Newton method.
* verlet method.

As the directory names indicate, the newton method and verlet method were implemented. 

I hope the reader could find the description inside the respective scripts helpfull. 

The most *polished* script is the one done with the verlet method.

**Note.** There is another script which implements the three methods inside a class. It is possible to call the file similarly as done with python libraries. ALthoguh, it is not yet finished but it will be soon.
